## Background Info

Quantium’s retail analytics team have been approached by a client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.
The insights from my analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

## Task
Examine transaction data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If you determine any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to your analysis. 

Examine customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.

Data analysis and customer segments – in your analysis make sure you define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find.
Deep dive into customer segments – define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis. 

Make sure you save your analysis in the CSV files and your visualisations – we will need them for our report.
